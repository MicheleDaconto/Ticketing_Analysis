# Support Tickets Analysis: Topic Modeling & Priority Classification

Collaborators: Ludovico Francia


### The Project

Starting from over 28,000 support tickets received by an IT department of a company, our research employs NLP techniques to automate the assignment of each ticket to a specific **topic** (thereby streamlining the routing to the appropriate team) and to predict the **priority** of each ticket by comparing the performance of various models.
